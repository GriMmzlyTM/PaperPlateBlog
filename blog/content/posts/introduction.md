## Introduction
Hello, you! 

Writing an introduction is always an awkward endevour, isn't it? Memories of the many "Firsts" life has to offer come to mind. 

First day of **class**, first **date**, first day at a new (and hopefully long-standing) **job**, and first **blog** **post**. It's always an awkward fumble, an attempt at getting whatever words you can muster out into the world in hopes that you'll escape this encounter alive, and hopefully, better understood. 

The "alive" part may, or may not be an exaggeration. I don't know your life. You very well may be an elite super spy whos introductions mean the difference between life and death.

### So, what's the purpose of this blog? 
Simple, my dear reader (Who, again, is probably me after I've forgotten something), this blog is simply a way for me to document interesting things I've found, or may be working on. That's it, there's nothing more to it. It may evolve in due time, however today, this is a repository of game development related topics I've learned, and think are interesting enough to write about in hopes that I'll remember. 

### And who are you? 
I'm a random person on the internet. I'm a game developer (Or, tools developer, I suppose) whos been working in the gaming industry for a few years.

I've worked at placed like Behaviour on Dead By Daylight, and Unity on... Ugh, well, Unity. 

Does this mean I'm qualified in any way? Abso-fricken-lutely not. I know nothing. In fact, chances are, anything I write about here is a thing I don't **actually** know much about, and I'm writing about it in hopes of fleshing out what little knowledge I've managed to acrue. 

Alright, bye now.
